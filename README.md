# Word-sense-Disambiguation

> Word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem of natural language processing. WSD is identifying which sense of a word (i.e. meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings.

The goal of this project is to train a program to be able to identify which of the 6 meaning of the word 'interest' is used in a sentence.

The data used come from:  http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/data.html
> 2368 occurrences in the sense tagged corpus, where each occurrence is a single sentence that contains the word 'interest'.

> Sense 1 =  361 occurrences (15%) - readiness to give attention
>
> Sense 2 =   11 occurrences (01%) - quality of causing attention to be given to
>
> Sense 3 =   66 occurrences (03%) - activity, etc. that one gives attention to
>
> Sense 4 =  178 occurrences (08%) - advantage, advancement or favor
>
> Sense 5 =  500 occurrences (21%) - a share in a company or business 
>
> Sense 6 = 1252 occurrences (53%) - money paid for the use of money

> The sense-tagged interest data is taken from the pos-tagged portion of the WSJ that appears in the ACL/DCI version of the Penn Treebank. Each instance of interest is tagged with one of six possible LDOCE senses.
